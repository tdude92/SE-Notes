# Sorting and Searching Algorithms (and Best/Avg/Worst Case Runtimes)

## Best/Average/Worst Case

Algorithms that take input can vary in runtime depending on the input values.

We still consider n to be some large number.
- Best Case: Best possible input arrangement.
- Worst Case: Worst possible input arrangement.
- Average Case: Harder to find; Take the mean of the runtimes of each possible input. Inputs could appear in different positions with different probabilities.

Linear Search Example:
- Best Case: Element we seek is the first element.
- Worst Case: Element we seek is the last element.
- Average Case:
